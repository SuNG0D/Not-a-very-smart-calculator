# Not-a-very-smart-calculator
A calculator made with tkinter an written with python for a school project, made by not a very smart student

As I already said, this is just a calculator that I have written for a school project and it's not very complex (I made it the 2nd day I started learning about tkinter...)

I still have work to do, since I want to make a fully functional calculator, because why not?

I will keep updating this until I finish, or I get bored of it.
